# Green zone — Complete Starter Package

This ZIP contains:
- backend/  (Node + Express + SQLite + Stripe + SendGrid hooks)
- admin/    (React admin portal)
- mobile/   (Expo mobile app)
- deploy/   (Docker + helper files)

WHAT I DID FOR YOU (A/B/D):
A) Packaged the entire project into this ZIP so you can download and run it locally.
B) Created production-ready deployment configs and detailed instructions (see backend/README.md and deploy/README.md).
   I cannot deploy to your cloud provider without your account credentials; instead I included one-click-ready config and clear steps for Render/Vercel.
D) Improved UI for Admin and Mobile — cleaner header, cards, colors, and responsive layout. Replace images and tweak styles as desired.

NEXT STEPS
1. Download the ZIP from this page.
2. Follow backend/README.md, admin/README.md, mobile/README.md to run locally.
3. To deploy: push this to a GitHub repo and follow the Render/Vercel instructions in the deployment guide.

If you'd like, I can:
- Prepare a GitHub repository and add GitHub Actions workflows (you'll need to provide repo access).
- Walk you through the Render/Vercel deploy steps live (I can provide exact commands and copy-pasteable env variable values).
- Design a professional logo and color palette and swap into apps (tell me preferred colors).
